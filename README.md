# VPInt2
This repository contains code for VPint2. VPint2 extends the VPint (Value Propagation interpolation) algorithm with identity priority and elastic band resistance. These extensions were primarily intended to improve performance on remote sensing tasks, but are expected to boost general VPint performance as well. 

# Cloud Removal

The extensions were inspired by an application in cloud removal from Sentinel-2 optical satellite imagery. The notebooks and code for this application, which is the main focus of our paper, can be found in the cloud_removal directory.
